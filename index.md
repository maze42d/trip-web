# Bringing TRIP back

The TRIP Resurgence project aims to rescue an old forgotten IETF protocol called
TRIP (Telephone Routing over IP) that was imagined by the designers of SIP,
the VoIP protocol.

The project came around as a member of [UwUtel](https://gitlab.com/uwutel/gitops) shared this protocol on the community,
and other members that liked the idea of using TRIP for telephone routing in UwUtel,
including the admin.

Unfortunately this protocol never caught on in the world of Telcos, and there is
only one publicly available archived implementation of it (others were known but are lost to time now).
So we have to implement a TRIP Routing Daemon (or Location Server in TRIP terms) ourselves.
This is the main project.
