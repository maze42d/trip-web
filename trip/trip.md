# The TRIP Protocol

The Telephony Routing over IP protocol, RFC 3219, is an application layer policy-based
dynamic routing protocol for telephone prefixes very similar to how BGP is for
network prefixes.

[RFC 3219](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3219)

TRIP has similar sessions, messages, attributes and route selection algorithm to BGP.

It first appeared in the IETF in 2001, as a real alternative for routing in
telephone networks.
