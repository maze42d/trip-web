# tripd

tripd is the TRIP Resurgence Location Server implementation, a telephone routing daemon.

As far as we know, it is the only modern maintained implementation in existence, as
we aim to implement all of the protocol by 2027 hopefully.

tripd is being written in C11 and built with CMake, with as little dependencies as possible,
currently zero.

Development is happening in the
[tripd Github organization repository](https://github.com/TRIP-Resurgence/tripd)
